<h1>AD-Design-and-Implementation-of-Company-Case</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
 In this project I will create a simulated enterprise network by configuring two virtual machines (VMs): one running Windows Server 2022 and the other Windows 10 using Hyper-V. Once both machines were created in Hyper-V, I configured the Machines, assigning computer names and IP addresses. After that I performed a ping test ensuring both machines can communicate with one another. Next, I installed the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role on the Windows Server Machine, promoted it to a domain controller, and joined the Windows 10 Machine to the newly created domain.
